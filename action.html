        No matter who you are (a student, educator, employee, parent, anyone), you can get involved with LGBTQ+ mental health advocacy. The best way to start is to educate yourself and those around you to make safe spaces for LGBTQ+ youth and help to end community rejection. Then, get involved on a school, city, and even state level to make mental health resources and medical care more accessible and less discriminatory to the LGBTQ+ community.

        Donating is a great way to help local, national, and international organizations from afar. These funds go into both helping LGBTQ+ youth directly and into efforts to change policy, also helping the community in the long run. If you have a chance, volunteer at your local schools or local LGBTQ+ youth centers for a wonderful hands-on experience. Organizations need your help in the effort to spread awareness and end this issue! If you're interested in learning more about organizations to donate to, click below!
